 <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Chidebelu Chinecherem Emmanuel. If someone were to ask me I will say I am someone that loves adventures, seeing new places, having new ideas and most eerie of them all taking new risks
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I was born in the early 2000's. I would say my family is quite Christain. Grew up in the Suburbs of Aba City. 
        I have had my failures tried out a few things here and there from attempting learning java to ending up a Medical Student down to applying for this scholarship.
    </p>

    <h2>Expectations</h2>
    <p>I joined this cohort with little belief in myself, I asked myself could I merge Health and Tech. 
        I have always been a lover of computers and the algorithms that amke them function. I hope that at the end of this program the multitasking will actualy pave way for an internship. 
        I am not seeking to get into a job yet, I just really want to learn. Knowing I know nothing I belive is my propulsion to gaining knowlwge
